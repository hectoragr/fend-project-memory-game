## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Game

The game starts as the page loads, or whenever you hit the restart icon.

Once that happens you have to flip each card, and it will compare two open cards to find a match.
If it finds a match you will keep both open, and continue to find matches until there are no more cards to match.
No matches return cards to hidden and keep your moves and time higher.
Once there are no more cards to match the game ends and tells you how many moves and seconds it took you to complete.
You lose one star each 30 seconds, you only got 3 of those.
